### ✨ introductions, of the informal variety ✨
hi, i'm Clare! i'm a computational biologist/bioengineer from new york city but i also dabble in uav design, osint, api & crawler security, and robotics (you can never leave [ftc](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc)). <br>

### questionably productive (software) engineering philosophies
- "why spend an hour doing something when you can spend ten hours automating it :3"
- "why learn blender when fusion360 has an animation tab \*insert clown music here\*"
- "brainf*ck can't be that hard, low-level languages are good to learn first"

### the obligatory languages/softwares/OS section
- bash, python, kotlin, brainf*ck, *terrible* javascript
- fusion 360, autocad, solidworks (cfd, mostly), keyshot (regrettably), indesign + illustrator, onshape, rhino
- pop-os! supremacy (i want a mac please)

### [call me, beep me, if you want to reach me!](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Rda027uD8ncoNMIXtngWL)
